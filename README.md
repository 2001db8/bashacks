## 1. What is this

 This is a fork of bashacks by Fernando MercÃªs, mainly to do some
 development.

## 2. Additional Requirements

* `whois`

## 3. Additional Functions

* `bh_ip2irt`: Look up abuse contact information and the relevant IRT
  object in `whois` for a given IP.
* `bh_host2irt`: Resolve a given host name to its IP address(es) and run
  `bh_ip2irt` on every one of those.
