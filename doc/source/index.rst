   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least

Welcome to bashacks's documentation!
====================================

Bashacks is an open source (GPL) set of bash functions probably useful for programmers, security analysts and general users that need to do some low level type of operation.

In fact, there nothing really new bashacks since all functions are write using exiting software in GNU/Linux distribuitions.

But you still can have advantage in use short commands to run tasks that commomnly will require a ot of lines to be done.
