1. What is it?

 hack-functions is an open source (GPL) set of bash functions 
 probably useful for programmers, security analysts and general
 users that need to do some low level type of operation.

 In fact, there is nothing really new in hack-functions since
 all funcitons are written using exiting software in GNU/Linux
 distributions. But you still can have advantage in use short
 commands to run tasks that commonly will require a lot of lines
 to be done.

 !!! IMPORTANT !!!
 There is no error handling in hack-functions. That's a job
 for bash, called programs and your responsability. :)


2. Requirements

 linux
 bash >= 4
 bc
 wget - and internet access
 hexdump
 grep
 objdump
 base64
 md5sum
 cut
 gdb
 rev
 html2text
 tee
 udcli e udis86 - for sc2asm() only
 nasm - for asm2sc() only
 iw 
 awk

3. Installation
 
 Put hack-functions.sh in some directory and 'source' it to your
 shell using .bashrc for example:

 $ sudo mv hack-functions.sh /opt
 $ echo "source /opt/hack-functions.sh" >> $HOME/.bashrc
 $ source /opt/hack-functions.sh

 And that's all. You can now call the available functions from bash.

 Additionally you need to install libudis86 to use sc2asm function. Go
 to http://udis86.sourceforge.net, download the latest version and run:

 $ tar xf udis86-*.tar.gz
 $ cd udis86-*
 $ ./configure
 $ make
 # make install
 $ cd udcli
 $ make
 # make install
